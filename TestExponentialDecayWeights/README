This is an implementation of a buffer in which a series of values are pushed and accumulated such that their sum can be returned.
Each samples contribution to the accumulator gets an exponential fall-off (or increase) at each push.
The decay and samples parameters of set(in)finiteDecay allows to set the decay an element undergoes after samples samples.
E.g. if decay=0.125 and samples=4 starting from a clean buffer
Value pushed  Accumulator
3.0           3.0
0.0           1.5
0.0           0.75
0.0           0.375
On the 5th (samples+1) value pushed the result will the differ depending on whether buffer was initializated as finite or infinite.
If it was set as infinite the contribution will keep reducing at the given rate (in the example on next push of a 0 value the accumulator will be 0.1875.
If it was set as finite the contribution will be (approximately) set to 0.
Note: If the buffer is set to infinte decay is checked to be less than 1 to be valid (to avoid diverging values of the accumulator).
