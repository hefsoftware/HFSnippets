This is an implementation in which every samples is weighted with an exponential fall-off (or increase).
The decay and samples parameters of set(in)finiteDecay allows to set the decay an element undergoes. 
In short if a sample with weight W is inserted after other samples-1 samples are inserted its contribution to 
accumulator will be decay*W. If the buffer is set-up as infinite the weight will keep reducing at the same rate.
If otherwise the buffer was set as finite the item contribution to accumulator if another insert is done will be approximately 0.
If the buffer is set to infinte decay must of course be less than 1 (otherwise the accumulator will reach infinity).
